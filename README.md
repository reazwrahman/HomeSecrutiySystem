# SmartHomeSecuritySystem
This is one of my personal projects. In this project I used a Raspberry Pi and a Pi camera to monitor my front door 24 hours. It uses an LED panel for night vision and an ultrasonic sensor to detect human occupancy: as soon as a human is detected in front of the system the raspberry pi sends emails to the listed users with a message and two still image attachments taken momentarily 5 seconds apart.
